I've always preferred the universal language of mathemathics and numbers over the English language. In fact, I often have so much trouble putting my thoughts into words, that I even find myself at times dreading having to compose text messages to my friends and family (sorry Mom). </p>\n<p>But whether I wanted it or not, this past year has given me more time alone inside my own head than I've ever had before. I've had countless thoughts constantly swirling around in there, oftentimes overwhelming me to the point of breaking. In order to try and find some relief from this confusion, I've decided to practice putting my thoughts down on paper (digital paper, that is) and expressing them to the world.</p>\n<p>Malcolm Gladwell made the argument in his book <em>Outliers</em> that if you want to become a world class expert at something, you need to devote 10,000 hours to that craft. I've finally realized that in order for me to grow into the person I want to be, to be able to truly help others, I need to work on expressing my ideas outside my own head. </p>\n<p>I hope that other people might be able to find some use from the things I write here, although I mostly intend for this to be my own personal writing and development playground. </p>\n<p>But I do genuinely hope that one day I can build what I'm starting here into something bigger, something that will be able to truly help spread the gift and magic of science to as many people as possible.</p>\n<p>(And if you're confused by my use of the word magic and science in the same sentence, this scene from Season 3, Episode 6 of Breaking Bad might provide a little context: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDnodgqcrP8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDnodgqcrP8</a>)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First Post","date":"December 21, 2020","path":"/first-post","tags":["2020"],"excerpt":"First one is always the hardest"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
